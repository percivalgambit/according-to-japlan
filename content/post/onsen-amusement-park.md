- we wake up late at noon
- think about what we want to do today, and decide to go to a spa
- we choose one in odaiba that's also an amusement park
- eventually (after scanning recepits for air canada) we leave our hostel and
  head towards the spa
- we get there successfully and wait for bosi there, but he went to the wrong
  place
- so we go to the spa without bosi
- its yuri on ice themed, so there are big banners of the characters outside and
  you could get coasters of the characters if you ordered certain food items
- we go to the onsen, and it was really nice
- we get some food from the food area and look at the merchandise
- we go back to our hostel, meet bosi there, and go to the bar in the basement
- he brought the russian roulette cookies we bought a few days ago and we played
  uno where the losers had to eat a cookie
- there were 2/12 bad cookies that were spicy
- then bosi left and we played a game of boss monster
- then we went to sleep since we had an early flight the next day
