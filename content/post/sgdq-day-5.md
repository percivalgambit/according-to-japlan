Today we woke up kinda late at 11am, and went down to the speedrunning room to
see a run of [Shadow of the
Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus). We wanted to
get International Drivers Permits today so we could do a tour of Tokyo on
go-karts once we got to Japan, so after the run we went next door to the
Minneapolis AAA to get the permits.  After getting the permits, we went back to
the speedrunning room to see a run of
[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)). We had some free
time before the next speedrun that we wanted to see, so we went back to the room
to hang out, then got dinner at the hotel.

Today was the beginning of runs of some of the most popular games at SGDQ. We
started with the Mario Kart block, which included [Mario Kart
64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_64) and [Mario Kart
Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii). Next, there was a tetris
block, which included an 8-way race of [Tetris: The Grand
Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master), a 2-players,
1-controller race of [Tetris: The Grand
Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master), a run of
[Tetris: The Grand
Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master) in Rev Mode
(everything upside down), and a run of [Tetris: The Grand Master 3: Terror
Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master#Tetris:_The_Grand_Master_3_-_Terror-Instinct).
After that, there was a Legend of Zelda block including a swordless run of [The
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the
Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past)
(which was amazing), a run of [Zelda 2: The Adventure of
Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link), and a
2-way race of [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
DX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening).
This block started very late, so we were very tired during it. We decided to
skip the run of Zelda 2 and take a 45 minute catnap in the room instead. We
managed to wake up for Link's Awakening, and stayed through the race of [Crypt
of the NecroDancer:
AMPLIFIED](http://store.steampowered.com/app/554000/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer_AMPLIFIED/).
It was practically the morning by the time the Crypt of the NecroDancer race was
over, so we all went back up to the room to go to sleep.
