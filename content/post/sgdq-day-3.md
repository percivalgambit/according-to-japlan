Today we woke up extra early to see a speedrun of the game [I am
Bread](http://www.iambreadgame.com/overview/), a weird game about bread that one
review said "[has] five stars for music, but two for the game".  Afterwards,
Aaron went to the cafe to do work and Michelle and I went back to the hotel
room, had breakfast, and watched an episode of [Tsurezure
Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsurezure_Children) while we were
waiting for the pizza we had ordered the previous day. We finally got our pizza
and ate a few slices for lunch. I was very tired at this point, so I took a nap
while Michelle went to the speedrunning room to see runs of [Brothers: A Tale of
Two Sons](http://www.brothersthegame.com/) and
[Banjo-Kazooie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie).

I woke up from my nap just in time for the block of Pokemon speed runs including
[Pokemon Puzzle
League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_League) and [Pokemon
HeartGold/SoulSilver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver).
There were no more runs that night that we wanted to see, so Michelle, Aaron,
and I went to a bar to celebrate the 4th of July and do some bar trivia.
Unfortunately, trivia was cancelled that night, but we were still able to go to
the bar and have some drinks. After having fun at the bar, we headed back to the
hotel and Aaron and I went to the speedrunning room to watch a quick run of
[Dishonored 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored_2). After the run, we
were all exhausted, so we went back up to the room to sleep.
