Today we made a new friend from the hostel. His name is Heinz and he hung out
with us all day. We started our day by going to the Denny's near our hostel for
breakfast. The food there was good, but very American, so we decided not to go
to Denny's again after today. After breakfast, we headed to Shinjuku to see the
[Meiji Shrine](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3002.html). On the way, we stopped
by a [Book Off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Off) to look for used video
games and books.

After stopping by Book Off, we went to the Meiji Shrine, which was surrounded by
Yoyogi Park. It was really hot out in the park, but it was very beautiful and
had lots of trees. We went through the park and got to the Meiji Shrine, which
also looked really pretty. After visiting the shrine, Aaron and Heinz went to
see the lilac garden near the shrine, and Michelle and I went to the cafe in the
shrine. While we were in the cafe, we got peach jelly parfaits, which were very
refreshing because it was so hot out. We met back up with Aaron and Heinz, just
in time for them to go off to get ramen for lunch while Michelle and I went to
an arcade. Aaron and Heinz met back up with us at the arcade after they finished
lunch. We played Jubeat, Dance Dance Revolution, and [Groove
Coaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Coaster) at the arcade. Finally,
we went to get conveyor belt sushi for dinner and went back to the hostel.
