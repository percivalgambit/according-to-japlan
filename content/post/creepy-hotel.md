- Got ice cream and gifts for aaron's cousin from target
- Ballroom was completely empty
- Back to hotel
- Hard to get back into the hotel
- Rode the shuttle to the airport
- 2 hour flight to Toronto
- We watched Get Out on the plane
- 18 hour layover in Toronto
- Got to the Toronto airport, but we couldn't check our bags, so we decided to
  go to a hotel for the night
- Went to the Days Inn Toronto West Mississuga
- We couldn't call the hotel to arrange the shuttle to pick us up, and there was
  no Uber at the airport, so we had to take a taxi there
- Super creepy hotel, like in Psycho
- We finished Get Out
- This morning we went to the tiny free breakfast there
- Shuttle to the airport
- We got there 4 hours early, but it took almost 2 hours to check-in
- Went to the duty-free shop in the airport
- Tried to find poutine in the airport
- Got on our 13 hour flight to Tokyo
