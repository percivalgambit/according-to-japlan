Today was our first day of travel to get to Japan. After we woke up, we went out
to Target to get ice cream and gifts for Aaron's cousin in Korea. We had to go
through the ballroom floor to get out of the hotel. They had all of the
speedruns on this floor and it was busy all week, but it was completely empty as
we walked through it today. After we got back to the hotel, it was time to go to
the airport, so we took the SGDQ shuttle there and checked in to our 2 hour
flight to Toronto. The flight went pretty smoothly, and we watched part of
[Get Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/) on the plane.

After our flight, we had an 18 hour layover in Toronto before our flight to
Tokyo, and we needed to figure out how to fill it. We tried to check our bags
for the Tokyo flight, but the earliest the airport would let us check our bags
was 4 hours before the flight. Since we had to hold on to our bags for the next
14 hours, we decided to try to book a room at a hotel near the airport for the
night. We chose the [Days Inn Toronto West
Mississauga](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154996-d188214-Reviews-Days_Inn_Toronto_West_Mississauga-Mississauga_Ontario.html),
which turned out to be a bad choice.

The hotel advertised a shuttle service from the airport, but the shuttles didn't
run on a regular schedule, so we needed to call the hotel to ask for a shuttle.
The only problem was that none of us had international calling on our phones. We
ended up finding a pay phone in the airport and tried calling from that, but we
just got put on hold and couldn't talk to anyone at the hotel. Since we weren't
able to book the shuttle, we tried to get an Uber from the airport to the hotel,
but Uber wasn't available in that area yet. All of our other options were
exhausted, so we had to get a cab from the airport to the hotel. The cab ride
cost us an arm and a leg, but we managed to get to the hotel and check in.

The hotel looked really creepy, like it was taken straight out of
[Psycho](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/). After we got situated in the
hotel room, we were really tired, so we finished watching Get Out and went to
sleep.  The next morning, we went to the tiny breakfast provided by the hotel,
then took the hotel shuttle to the airport. We got to the airport 4 hours early
to check our bags for the flight, but the line to check-in took almost 2 hours
to get through. While we were waiting until we could board the airplane, we
visited the duty-free shop at the airport, contemplated buying maple syrup, and
looked for poutine but were unable to find any. Finally, we boarded the plane
for out 13 hour flight to Tokyo
