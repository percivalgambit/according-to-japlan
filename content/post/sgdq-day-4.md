Today, there were no runs that we were very interested in seeing in the morning
or afternoon, so we were able to wake up late. Aaron needed to do work today,
but Michelle and I wanted to visit the [Mall of
America](https://www.mallofamerica.com/), so we looked up how to get there. We
wanted to try to bike there using [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.org/), a
bikesharing program in Minneapolis, but there were no Nice Ride stations close
to the mall.  We ended up not being able to bike there, so we took the tram.

The Mall of America was huge! It had an indoor amusement park, aquarium, mini
golf, and a food court. It also had the best digital directory user interface
I've ever seen. We spent most of the day wandering around the mall.  First we
went to Barnes and Noble to look at all of the books. Next we went to both of
the Gamestops in the mall to see what games they had. Then we went through the
Nickelodeon amusement park, the Crayola store, and the Lego store.  We were
getting hungry after this, so we went to the food court and had grilled cheese
for lunch. We wanted ice cream for dessert, but were too full after lunch, so we
went to Barnes and Noble to hang out and read books while we waited to digest
our food. After about an hour at Barnes and Noble, we were hungry again, so we
got ice cream from the mall. Then we went back to the hotel for a night of
watching speedruns.

We made it back to the hotel just in time for the Megaman X block of speedruns,
which included [Megaman X6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X6) [Megaman
X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)), a 4-way race of
[Megaman X2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X2), and a 2-way race of
[Megaman X3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X3). Next, there was a run
of [The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess).
After this, Aaron was tired so he went to sleep, but Michelle and I stayed up
for the run of [The Elder Scrolls IV:
Oblivion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion), which
was great. After that, we went to sleep.
