Today, there were no runs that we were very interested in seeing in the morning
or afternoon, so we were
able to wake up late. Aaron needed to do work today, but Michelle and I wanted
to visit the Mall of America, so we looked up how to get there. We wanted to try
to bike there using [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.org/), a bikesharing
program in Minneapolis, but there were no Nice Ride stations close to the mall.
We ended up not being able to bike there, so we took the tram.
