SGDQ raises money to donate to charity, and yesterday they hit 1 million dollars
in donations, so today they had a cake party to celebrate and thank all
of the attendees. We woke up just in time for the cake party, so we went
downstairs to get some cake. Afterwards, we went to Target to buy some food, and
I also got a new tank top and Deadpool-patterned button-down shirt, along with a
pair of shorts.

After Target, we went back to the hotel room and ordered food for lunch and
dinner, since we would be watching speedruns for the rest of the day. While we
waited for the food to arrive, we watched the speedrun of [Super Panga
World](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxG7HQxMIfYrkzSzsjGE7a9bIghP43Y9H),
a set of almost impossible custom levels created for Super Mario World. The food
arrived and we ate it, then we went down to the speedrunning room to watch runs
of [Super Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) and [The
Legend of Zelda: Majora's
Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask). There
was a bonus incentive that required $100,000 of donations for a speedrun of [The
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild)
that was met, so there was also a speedrun of Breath of the Wild. After the
Breath of the Wild incentive was met, there was another $200,000 incentive for a
single person speedrun of the co-op mode in [Portal
2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2), which was also met, so there was a
super bonus speedrun of Portal 2. Finally, the last speedrun of SGDQ was one of
[Earthbound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound). After that speedrun, we
went to sleep, since we had a long flight the next day.
