We woke up at noon today because we stayed up pretty late last night watching
speedruns. We woke up just in time for a pizza party sponsored by SGDQ, and we
went downstairs to get free pizza for lunch. After eating our pizza, we went to
the speedrunning room to see a run of [Kingdom Hearts
II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II). There was a Disney
sing-a-long during the speedrun, so we got to listen to the runners sing [I'll
Make a Man Out of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSS5dEeMX64), [Part of
Your World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKlJuO07eM), [A Whole New
World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kl4hJ4j48s),
[Gaston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0), and
[Hellfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3NoDEu7kpg). After the run, we went
to the arcade room to play [Jubeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubeat),
[D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Shadow_over_Mystara),
[Sunset Riders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Riders), and [Dance Dance
Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution).

After playing games in the arcade room for a while, we went back to the
speedrunning room to see Super Mario Warpless Relay Race, which involved 3 teams
of 5 speedrunners each racing through 5 [Super
Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario) games. It was a long race, but
all of the teams managed to finish within 8 minutes of each other, which was
amazing. Next, we watched the Metroid block which included [Metroid
Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Fusion) and [Super
Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid). We went back to the
arcade room to play more D&D, Jubeat, and DDR, then we went up to the room to
get ready for bed. Right before we went to sleep, Michelle and I showed Aaron
the first episode of [Groove Master
Rave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave_Master), a hilariously bad anime, since
he hadn't seen it before.
