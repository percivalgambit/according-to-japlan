- went out to Hikarigaoka in the very western part of Tokyo to go to a yosakoi
  dancing festival after our new friend Natsuki reccomended it
- saw lots of cool dances and explored the festival
- Natsuki used to be a yosakoi dancer so she knew a lot about it
- Natsuki took us to take our pictures with lots of different dancing groups
- we ate okonomiyaki for lunch from a vendor at the festival
- we had to leave to go to mario kart in shinagawa
- when we got to mario kart, michelle was feeling sick, so we decided to
  reschedule and go back to the hostel to rest
