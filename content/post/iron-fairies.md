- We started the day by going into the odaiba suburbs to see a water museum
- the museum was practically empty except for the workers there, which was great
  because they were all really nice
- it was a museum for children, but still really fun for us
- There were cool science experiments on the second floor
- afterwards, we went to venus fort, a giant shopping mall in odaiba that looks
  like little italy, like las vegas
- we went to the harikyu gardens to see nature
- we went back to the hostel and got dinner near there at a fancyish place
- we met bosi and emily at the iron fairy bar, a hipster bar in chuou
