      <title>SGDQ Day 3: Five Star Music, Two Star Game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we woke up extra early to see a speedrun of the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iambreadgame.com/overview/&#34;&gt;I am
Bread&lt;/a&gt;, a weird game about bread.
Afterwards, Aaron went to the cafe to do work and Michelle and I went back to
the hotel room, had breakfast, and watched an episode of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsurezure_Children&#34;&gt;Tsurezure
Children&lt;/a&gt; while we were
waiting for the pizza we had ordered the previous day. We finally got our pizza
and ate a few slices for lunch. I was very tired at this point, so I took a nap
while Michelle went to the speedrunning room to see runs of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brothersthegame.com/&#34;&gt;Brothers: A Tale of
Two Sons&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie&#34;&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up from my nap just in time for the block of Pokemon speed runs including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_League&#34;&gt;Pokemon Puzzle
League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver&#34;&gt;Pokemon
HeartGold/SoulSilver&lt;/a&gt;.
There were no more runs that night that we wanted to see, so Michelle, Aaron,
and I went to a bar to celebrate the 4th of July and do some bar trivia.
Unfortunately, trivia was cancelled that night, but we were still able to go to
the bar and have some drinks. After having fun at the bar, we headed back to the
hotel and Aaron and I went to the speedrunning room to watch a quick run of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored_2&#34;&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/a&gt;. After the run, we
were all exhausted, so we went back up to the room to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SGDQ Day 2: Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches</title>
      <link>http://according-to-japlan.tk/post/sgdq-day-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning we were planning on waking up at 9:30am, but we were woken up at
8:30 because that&amp;rsquo;s when housekeeping wanted to clean the room. After we became
more awake, Aaron went to a cafe to do work for the day (he&amp;rsquo;s working from home
this week, so he&amp;rsquo;s not going to any speedruns during work hours). Michelle and I
went down to the hotel lobby to ask if SGDQ provided free breakfast. There was
no free breakfast from the hotel, but today the convention organizers got free
donuts for the attendees. We got there right when the donuts arrived, so we got
our pick of them. After finishing our donuts, we went to the speedrunning room
to see the runs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)&#34;&gt;Crash
Bandicoot&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyro:_Year_of_the_Dragon&#34;&gt;Spyro: Year of the
Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t any more runs that we wanted to see for a while after this, so
Michelle and I went back up to the room to work on our blogs. We were also
getting hungry for lunch at this point, so after working for a bit we headed
next door to Target to scavenge up some food. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a fridge,
microwave, or any way to boil water in the room, so our options for food were
quite limited. We ended up getting peanut butter, nutella, bread, bananas, and
apples for sandwiches, since none of those ingredients requires a fridge or
microwave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Target, we went back to the room and ate lunch. Aaron came back from
working soon after this, and we went down to see a block of Sonic speedruns that
included &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Generations&#34;&gt;Sonic Generations&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Colors&#34;&gt;Sonic Colors&lt;/a&gt;. We came back up
to the room to eat a dinner consisting of peanut butter and banana sandwiches.
While we were in the room I managed to beat &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild&#34;&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
Wild&lt;/a&gt;, a
game I had been playing for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we went back down to the speedrunning room to see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge&#34;&gt;Mirror&amp;rsquo;s
Edge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge_Catalyst&#34;&gt;Mirror&amp;rsquo;s Edge
Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_64&#34;&gt;Donkey
Kong 64&lt;/a&gt;. We took a short break
after Donkey Kong to go back to the room. Aaron went to sleep because he needed
to wake up early to do more work, but Michelle and I went back down to the
speedrunning room to see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio_Future&#34;&gt;Jet Set Radio
Future&lt;/a&gt;. During this run, I
got hungry for pizza, so we decided to order two pizzas to be delivered the next
day so we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to eat peanut butter and banana sandwiches for every meal.
We got bored of the Jet Set radio future run, so after a while we went back to
the room. We weren&amp;rsquo;t quite tired yet, so Michelle showed me an episode of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave_Master&#34;&gt;The
Groove Adventure Rave&lt;/a&gt;, a weird and
hilarious anime. Finally, we went to sleep to get ready for another day of SGDQ.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SGDQ Day 1: This Shopping Mall is Empty</title>
      <link>http://according-to-japlan.tk/post/sgdq-day-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2017 23:44:08 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://according-to-japlan.tk/post/sgdq-day-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today began at the early hour of 4:30am, when I had to drag myself out of bed
and go to the airport with my parents. After a teary goodbye, I was quickly off
on a plane to my first destination: Minneapolis, MN. My flight went really
smoothly, and I landed in the Minneapolis airport two and a half hours later.
Things were going well for me, but not so much for my friends. Their flight from
Chicago was delayed for an hour and a half, so instead of landing at the airport
half an hour before me, they landed a full hour after me. Eventually, we all met
up at the airport and caught the SGDQ shuttle to the hotel we would be staying
at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to the hotel just in time to drop our bags off, check in for SGDQ, and go
to the speedrunning room before the first game started.  The convention kicked
off with a really interesting speedrun: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/halfcoordinated&#34;&gt;a
speedrunner&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier:_Automata&#34;&gt;Nier:
Automata&lt;/a&gt; using only one hand. The
speedrunner was disabled and had limited use of his right hand, so he learned
how to play the game using only his left hand. This was a fun speedrun to watch,
especially since it was so unique.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://according-to-japlan.tk/img/minneapolis_hotel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A picture of our hotel in Minneapolis. Michelle for scale.&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the speedrun was over, we realized we were all starving, so we went
outside to find something to eat and explore Minneapolis. We didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it
at the time, but this was much harder to do than we thought. First of all, there
was massive construction happening on the streets surrounding the hotel, so it
was hard to get anywhere outside. Luckily, there were skyways connecting the
hotel and all of the buildings surrounding it, so we could travel between all of
the buildings. There was a shopping mall next door to the hotel, so we decided
to go there to find something for lunch.  What we didn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that almost
every store in Minneapolis closes for the weekend. The mall was like a ghost
town because almost all of the stores there were closed and there were barely
any people there. To make it worse, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any directories or signs, so
it was very easy to get lost. We wandered around for about an hour, but we
couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any place to get food that was open and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a line
extending out the door. Eventually, we just camped out in an empty hallway in
the shopping mall and ate some of the breakfast bars that I packed for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we got up from the hallway and got back to the hotel, it was almost
time for dinner. After our unsuccessful excursion, we decided that it would be
better to order food to the hotel than to try to go out again. While we ate, we
watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moana_(2016_film)&#34;&gt;Moana&lt;/a&gt; since Aaron had
never seen it before. After dinner, we went back to the speedrunning room to
watch speedruns of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddy_Kong_Racing&#34;&gt;Diddy Kong
Racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion&#34;&gt;Luigi&amp;rsquo;s
Mansion&lt;/a&gt;. There were more
interesting speedruns after those, but we got bored of sitting and watching
things, so we decided to explore the game rooms set up for the convention. We
found the arcade game room and stayed there for a good hour.  Michelle and I
played against each other at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_(video_game)&#34;&gt;Tekken&lt;/a&gt; while Aaron tried
his hand at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)&#34;&gt;Donkey
Kong&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, we
all played &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battletoads_Arcade&#34;&gt;Battletoads&lt;/a&gt;, one
of the hardest arcade games ever, and managed to beat it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://according-to-japlan.tk/img/janky_fridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We had leftovers from dinner but no fridge to store them in, so we improvised.&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the hotel room, but we were all exhausted at this point, so we
were all falling asleep while we were hanging out there. There was one final
speedrun we wanted to see before we went to bed, so we rallied and went back to
the speedrunning room to watch the run of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckami&#34;&gt;Okami&lt;/a&gt; before we finally crashed for
the night. All in all, this was a great day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my travel blog! This is a blog to describe the trip I am taking with
two of my best friends from college during the summer before I start work. First
we&amp;rsquo;re staying in Minneapolis for a week for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamesdonequick.com/&#34;&gt;Summer Games Done
Quick&lt;/a&gt;, then we&amp;rsquo;re headed to Japan for 4 weeks, and
finally to South Korea for a week.  It should be a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;
